A small prototype of De-Panther WebXR Exporter for Unity (https://github.com/De-Panther/unity-webxr-export) in combination with VRTK (https://www.vrtk.io/).

... blablabla sample scene with a demo of interactions and hand tracking
... tried to keep it very similar to VRTKs input prefabs
... optimized the whole setup and testing process, YT link here ->
